# That’sTrippy - Vacation Destination Recommendation App

## Project Overview

That’sTrippy is an interactive web application designed to help users discover their perfect vacation destination. By answering a series of questions related to climate, activities, budget and more (to be decided), the app generates personalized vacation recommendations.

_**It should also feature interactive elements, to make the selection process more engaging.**_

### Key Features:
- **Quiz Section**: Collects user preferences like climate and activities etc.
- **Gamification**: Users engage with fun and interactive componets (to be decided, pending group chat) to select their vacation type.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Based on user input, the app suggests vacation spots. (This is going to need us all to chat as a group and figure out the logic for it)
- **Persistent Storage**: (yes? no?)

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the app (header, form, game, and result sections).
- **CSS**: Styling, including responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user input, processes data, and generates recommendations.
- **CSS Framework (?)** Still need to decide which we should use.
