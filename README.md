# That’sTrippy - Vacation Destination Recommendation App

## Project Overview

That’sTrippy is an interactive web application designed to help users discover their perfect vacation destination. By answering a series of questions related to climate, activities, and budget, the app generates personalized vacation recommendations. It also features interactive elements, such as a mini-game, to make the selection process more engaging.

### Key Features:
- **Quiz Section**: Collects user preferences like climate and activities.
- **Gamification**: Users engage with a fun game to select their vacation type.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Based on user input, the app suggests vacation spots.
- **Persistent Storage**: User preferences are saved using local storage, so data isn’t lost on page reload.
